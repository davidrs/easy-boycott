# easy-boycott
A Chrome Extension to make it easy to boycott companies.

Initial focus is boycotting companies that use prison labour, but could be expanded to support various campaigns users could opt-in to.

## Why Prison Labour?
It is essentially moden day, government endorsed, slavery. 
Protected by the dated notion that people convicted of crimes no longer have rights.
As the 13th amendment says: "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, *except as punishment for crime*...". I think job training and work experience are incredibly important pieces of rehabilitation and integration, but if someone is doing work they deserve at least minimum wage, not $0.23 - $1.15 [http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/14/smallbusiness/federal-prison-business/]. 

This app makes it easy to identify and boycott companies that use prison labour, while browsing online.
